# An Analysis of Oahu Temperatures in June and December

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to closely investigate temperature statistics for Oahu in June and December to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. This analysis was done by running queries on the data based on month and converting the data to dataframes in order to gather summary statistics.  

## Results
For June:
- The average temperature is about 75 degrees.
- The low is 64 degrees.
- The high is 85 degrees.

- The low is 56 degrees.
- The high is 83 degrees.

## Summary
The results from the analysis are insufficient to make a definitive conclusion, but it is a good start. With average temperature only differing only about 4 degrees between June and December, temperatures for surfing seem to be adequate for year round surfing. While the lows can get a bit low in December, the high is only 2 degrees away from June's, meaning serving ice cream in December still makes sense for this area. The December lows can get a bit low, so offering a "warm weather" food option would be a good idea. It is good to know that temperature would not be a barrier to opening a surf/ice cream shop in Oahu, but I would run analyses on other weather phenomenon, such as precipitation, humidity, snow, etc. to see if there are other weather variables outside of just temperature that could bolster/hinder the opening of the shop. I would also would look at other data sources, such as travel data, to see if people are visiting Oahu at similar levels throughout the year to make sure that there are customers available for the shop year-round.
